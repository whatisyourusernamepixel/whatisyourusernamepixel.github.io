# go_to_sleep
Simple webpage with advice on getting better sleep. 
Straightforward CSS, simple JS functions like dark mode button or popup that shows up after 30 seconds

Kind of responsive.No templates used -- each .html file needs to be edited separately

## How to deploy a site

1. Register at github.com
2. Register at render.com -- choose free price plan
3. For a repository: https://github.com/inthecure/go_to_sleep
4. Go to Render dashboard:  https://dashboard.render.com/
5. Click New > Static Site
6. Enter your site name -- it will look like example.render.com
7. Enter a dot . under Publish Directory -- leave other settings unchanged
8. Click Create Static Site

## What next

- Go to github.com > click profile picture in top right > Your Repositories
- Click on the name of your repository -- go_to_sleep
- Click on index.html > click edit file in top right
- Paste Pixel code between <head> and </head> tags
- Experiment:
  *  install events
  *  set up custom conversions
  *  use Event Setup Tool
  *   verify domain

## Setup tips

Site pages are files ending with .html
Each .html page is separate from other -- so a Pixel needs to be set up on every page separately. 

Same goes for any code: events, domain verification, etc.
